This project was created by Facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and `yarn run eject` command.

Steps that I did:
* `npx create-react-app ejected-create-react-app`
* `cd ejected-create-react-app`
* `yarn run eject` (choose `y`)
* transfer eslint, jest, babel, and browserslist configs to their own separate files from `package.json` file
* clean up `config` and `scripts` folders based on eslint
